Mathematic library includes:

* `Integer extensions <int_ext/>`_ with integer vector and related
  operations,

* `Arithmentic utilities <arith/>`_ Various operators and functions
  around integer values (log2, min, max, gcdm lcm, power-of-two
  alignment tools, convertor to unsigned with implicit size
  calculation),

* `Gray encoding <gray>`_ tools and components,

* `GF(2) <gf2>`_ definitions,

* `Fixed point <fixed/>`_ library, with careful usage of type ranges
  as value extents,

* `Fader blocks <fader/>`_, able to scale two values according to a
  third, in a complementary way,

* `Real extensions <real_ext/>`_ with real vector, various functions
  (min, max, erf, frac),

* `Timing calculus <timing/>`_ with conversion from VHDL time units to
  cycles, seconds, etc.
